# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to cachet! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
- **Documentation**: add documentation for this project when contributing code, write best-practices or tips&tricks in general.
- **Financial**: we welcome financial contributions by [sponsoring this project](https://github.com/sponsors/cachethq)

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request ever? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Not too familiar with markdown? Have a look at this also free [Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to get started or refresh your memory.

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## Security Vulnerabilities

Please review our [security policy](https://github.com/cachethq/cachet/security/policy) on how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Questions

If you have any questions, create an [issue](issue) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).
