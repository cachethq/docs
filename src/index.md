## Features

### JSON API

Sometimes it's simply not possible to manually update your status page with incidents and component status changes. That's why Cachet is bundled with a simple, but powerful, JSON API.

### Scheduled Maintenance

It can't be avoided, sometimes you just need to perform maintenance. With Cachet, you can schedule events ahead of time. Once the maintenance time has passed, the incident drops into the timeline for posterity.

### Metrics
 
Within the dashboard you're able to setup metrics - a way to measure something, whether it's uptime, error rates or something completely random like "cups of coffee drank today".
